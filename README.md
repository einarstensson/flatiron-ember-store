# Flatiron Ember Store

## Objectives

1. Define a route that renders a specific handlebars template. 
2. Define a route handler to return model data. 
3. User Handlebars to render model data.
4. Build a controller action to respond to user events on the page. 
5. Build a component and pass data into that component to be rendered on the page. 

## Overview

Our goal is to create a simple Ember app that allows uses to quickly and easily browse the products available for sale at the Flatiron Ember Store. A user should be able to visit the landing page and click a link to the products index page. On that page, a user should be able to click on the name of any product on the list and see the product details rendered immediately on the page, without the page having to refresh and without visiting another page. Check out the demo below to get a better idea of what we'll be building:
